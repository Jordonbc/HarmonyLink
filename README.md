Welcome to the server-side application for the HarmonyLink project. This innovative software is developed with the Rust programming language and is aimed at enhancing the handheld gaming experience.

## The Vision and The Reality

The central goal with HarmonyLink is to provide a comprehensive and interactive gaming experience on handheld devices. This client-side application is a crucial part of this vision.

## Key Features

1. **Device Identification**: HarmonyLink equips games with the ability to identify the specific handheld device they are operating on.
2. **Real-Time Metrics**: Games can access real-time data about the handheld device's power usage and docking status through HarmonyLink.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: HarmonyLink extends its functionality to Windows games running on Proton/Wine.

## Using HarmonyLinkServer

For users who wish to run the precompiled release version of HarmonyLinkServer, please follow the instructions specific to your platform below.

### Windows Users

1. Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/Jordonbc/HarmonyLinkServer/releases/latest) on the project's GitHub page.
2. Download the `.zip` archive for Windows.
3. Extract the contents of the `.zip` archive to a directory of your choice.
4. Open a command prompt in the directory where you extracted the files.
5. Run the HarmonyLinkServer executable by typing `./harmony_link_server.exe`.

Please note that you'll need to manually start the program each time you want to use it.

### Steam Deck (Linux) Users

1. Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/Jordonbc/HarmonyLinkServer/releases/latest) on the project's GitHub page.
2. Download the `.zip` archive for Linux.
3. Extract the contents of the `.zip` archive to a directory of your choice.

#### Running in Desktop Mode

To use HarmonyLinkServer in Desktop Mode, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the directory where you extracted the files.
2. Run the HarmonyLinkServer executable by typing `./harmony_link_server`.

Please note that you'll need to keep the terminal window open while using HarmonyLinkServer in desktop mode.

#### Optional: Setting Up as a Service for Gamemode

For a seamless experience in gamemode, you have the option to set up HarmonyLinkServer as a service on your Steam Deck. Please be aware that this setup process will require a moderate level of technical knowledge.

## How It Works

HarmonyLink operates using a client-server structure. This server-side application runs on the host side (native Linux or Windows), and games access the metrics via an API.

Developers and modders can easily implement GET and POST requests from the API, integrating system metrics into games. These metrics can be used to adapt the game's quality settings, providing a more customized gaming experience.
